üìë Report: Analytical Insights from Premier League 2021/22 ‚Äî iGaming Perspective
1. Introduction

The aim of this project was to analyze Premier League 2021/22 match data to uncover patterns in goals, results, referee effects, team discipline, and bookmaker odds.

The analysis was performed using R (for statistical exploration) and Power BI (for interactive visualization).

This report highlights the key insights and their potential business value for an iGaming company, with a focus on improving market efficiency, product offerings, and customer engagement.

2. Match Overview

Total Matches: 380

Mean Goals per Match: 2.82

Over 2.5 Goals Frequency: 53.9%

Key Findings

The most common outcomes were home wins (43%), followed by away wins (34%) and draws (23%).

Goal distribution shows that most matches ended with 2‚Äì3 total goals, confirming the balance of defensive and attacking play.

Business Value

Provides baseline market calibration for Over/Under lines.

Useful for promotional campaigns (e.g., highlighting ‚Äúaverage goals per game‚Äù in marketing content).

Supports betting market design (e.g., default line at 2.5 goals is justified).



3. Team Discipline & Referee Effects
Referee Influence

Average total goals per referee ranged from 1.3 to 3.5 goals per game.

Some referees (e.g., Gillett, Marriner) tended to oversee higher-scoring matches.

Team Discipline

Leeds had the highest card average (2.8 per game), while Man City had the lowest (1.2).

A positive correlation (r ‚âà 0.36) was found between average cards and loss rate.

Business Value

Risk management: Certain referees correlate with higher scoring ‚Üí potential adjustment of totals markets.

Player engagement: ‚ÄúHot-headed‚Äù teams like Leeds may be targeted with prop markets (e.g., cards specials).

Trading strategy: Stronger link between discipline and poor results can guide live-betting adjustments.



4. Half-Time ‚Üí Full-Time Dynamics
Findings

If a team leads at half-time, they hold the lead ~76% of the time (both home and away).

Comebacks are rare:

Home comebacks: 10%

Away comebacks: 6%

From draw at HT:

37% ‚Üí Home win

29% ‚Üí Away win

Business Value

HT/FT betting markets can be priced more accurately using these insights.

Fan engagement: comebacks are rare but exciting ‚Äî content opportunities (social media, marketing).

Live betting: odds can shift more aggressively in favor of the team leading at HT.



5. Odds Analysis
Bookmaker Margins

Margins varied significantly:

Pinnacle lowest (2.6%) ‚Üí most player-friendly.

VC Bet highest (6.5%).

Calibration (Implied vs Actual)

Bet365 1X2:

Implied probabilities closely matched actual results (Home 46% vs 43%, Away 34% vs 34%).

Bet365 Over/Under 2.5:

Implied (52.5% Over) vs Actual (53.9% Over) ‚Üí very accurate.

Business Value

Market efficiency check: confirms Premier League markets are highly efficient (hard to exploit arbitrage).

Competitive intelligence: Pinnacle‚Äôs margins highlight how sharper operators attract high-volume players.

Product offering: sportsbooks can differentiate by lowering margin on popular markets (loss-leader strategy).



6. Conclusion

This project demonstrated that data-driven insights can provide value across multiple dimensions:

Market calibration ‚Üí confirming accuracy of odds and setting baselines.

Risk management ‚Üí identifying high-scoring referees, disciplined vs undisciplined teams.

Product innovation ‚Üí designing new markets around HT/FT dynamics and team discipline.

Competitive strategy ‚Üí benchmarking bookmaker margins and pricing.
